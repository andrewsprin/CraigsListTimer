Design Notes
============

Input
=====
-Search Query Information
	-What they are looking for (Text Box)
	-What CL category they want to search (spinner/scrollable)
	-Should the search also search the title? (checkbox)
	-Should the search be limited to results with pictures?(checkbox)
	-What city they want to search (Needs to be designed)
	-How often should the app search for new results (Needs to be designed)
-I think that there should be a way to add/remove/edit exisiting queries

Output
======
-List of existing Searches
-List of results for existing searches
-Pages for individual results

As for what information belongs on what screens regarding input is still 
completely up in the air, as well as what the output pages would look like.

For android, google provides base widgets (that are currently being used), that
can be essentially completely customized, so I should be able to make any mock
ups functional relatively easily so long as it isn't in the realm of 3D. At 
first glance, it looks like there is a way to do custom animations as well.
